This is three scripts/programs I wrote that generates 'brainrot' sentences. `oldcode.lua` is the one I made in 2023, `revampedcode.lua` is a revamp, and when I realized that revampedcode wasn't too good, I made `evenmorerevampedcode.lua`.

This is the video explaining how I made it: (NA)

# Running the code

For `oldcode`, just put it in a compiler and run it. For `revampedcode` and `evenmorerevampedcode`, you need Love2D to run it and you need to rename it to `main.lua` (or you can copy the function and put it in a compiler)
